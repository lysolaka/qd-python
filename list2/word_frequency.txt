The function accepts a string of comma-separated binary numbers.
It splits the input string into individual binary numbers.
It checks if each binary number is valid (contains only 0s and 1s).
If a binary number is invalid, it prints an error message and exits the function.
For valid binary numbers, it converts them to their decimal equivalent and checks if they are divisible by 5.
The valid binaries that are divisible by 5 are collected and printed as a comma-separated string.
