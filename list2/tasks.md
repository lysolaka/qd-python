# List 2

## Tuples multiplication
Write a script to calculate the product, multiplying all the numbers in a given tuples.

Example:
```
Original Tuple: (4, 3, 2, 2, -1, 18)
Product - multiplying all the numbers of the said tuple: -864
```
The inputs are in format: `(1, 2, 3)`. You can use `eval()` to change the input string to a tuple. As an output, print out the result of multiplication.

## Palindromes
Write a script to check if a list is a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) or not. If the list is a palindrome, print True, otherwise print False.

Example:
```
input: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'b', 'a']
output: True
```

## Key search
Write a script to find all keys in a dictionary that have the given value.

The input is a string represantation of a dictionary and the value to search for separated by a comma.

Example:
```
input: {'Theodore': 19, 'Roxanne': 20, 'Mathew': 21, 'Betty': 20}, 20
output: ['Roxanne', 'Betty']
```

## Remove duplicates
Write a script that removes all duplicate elements from a list and returns a new list.

Example:
```
input: [1, 3, 5, 1, 3, 7, 9]
output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```
Remember! the input is a string represantation of a list

Hint: use list comprehension

## Read from file
Write a script to write and read a list's content to and from a file.

## Word frequency
Write a script to count the frequency of words in a text file. Plot the results using bar graph. For plots use matplotlib (obviously).

## ZeroDivisionError
Write a script to handle a ZeroDivisionError exception when dividing a number by zero.

If there occurs division by zero, you should print "Division by zero is not defined". Otherwise print the result of division.

The input is two numbers separated by a comma, example:
```
21, 7
```
would be read as `21/7`.

## CO2 Emissions
Read the `co2_emissions.csv` file and visualize the data in at least 2 different types of charts of your choice, then save them in 3 different picture formats of your choice. The graphs should make logical sense and one should be able to read them. Again without any doubt matplotlib should be used.
